Based on the message from Sharon, it looks like she’s open to you continuing but is concerned about the logistics of another 8-month internship since the company can’t replace the role until the next term.

You could respond with something like this:

Hi Sharon,

Thanks for the update and for considering me to continue. I understand the concern about the length of the internship. I’m definitely open to discussing it further with Jovic to see what options there might be. If it helps the team in any way, I’d be happy to explore solutions, whether it’s adjusting the length of my internship or finding another way to contribute.

Let me know what you think, and I can also reach out to Jovic to discuss logistics.

Thanks again!

This keeps things flexible and shows you’re willing to work out the details.
