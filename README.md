Subject: Chat About My Role

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I just wanted to touch base about my position since we’re in the process of hiring someone new. I noticed that one of the candidates we interviewed last week has taken another role.

I wanted to mention that I’m really interested in the possibility of extending my time here, if that’s something we could consider. I’ve loved working with the team and feel like I can keep contributing during this transition period.

Let me know if you’d be open to chatting about this!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
