Here’s a more subtle way to convey your willingness:

Hi Sharon,

Thanks for your response! I completely understand the concern, but I personally don’t see the 8-month term as something that would hold me back. I’ve really enjoyed my time here and would love to continue contributing for as long as it makes sense for the team.

I’ll reach out to Jovic to discuss the logistics and see if we can figure out a good solution.

Appreciate your support!
[Your Name]  

This version is softer while still expressing your willingness to stay.
